# What the hell is this?

Arrow is a web application. That's the first thing.    
It's an ideea. It's a concept. It's a revolution.    

## It's almost native.

It is built in such a way that it blends in the operating system, no matter which one it is.     
It's built ontop of modern web technologies, and is integrated with regular desktop browsers (*no IE*) and FirefoxOS.    

It's an application you can take with you in the same shape and form everywhere. There are no different applications for different terminals.

## It's just one

And on top of that, it's live and in the cloud.
